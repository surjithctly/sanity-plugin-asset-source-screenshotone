## Installation

```
sanity install asset-source-screenshotone
```

## Configuration

This plugin is based on this awesome tool called [Screenshot One](https://screenshotone.com/). Create a free account to get started. Then go to the "Access" tab and copy your Access Key. Then add your access key to `<your-studio-folder>/config/asset-source-screenshotone.json`:

```json
{
  "AccessKey": "<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE>"
}
```

## Done

That's it. Now whenever you add an image field, you can see "Screenshot from URL" link from the dropdown. Then you can generate and insert the screenshot with the settings available.
